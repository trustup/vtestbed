The model has two tanks: mainTank, secondaryTank
the mainTank fills through valve_1 and empties through valve_output, each of two phases takes 200sec

During the emptying phase (valve 1 is closed - valve_output is open - valve 2 is open) the flow of water is directed to the secondary tank (through valve 2) until the MainTank is empty and begins to fill again (valve 1 open - valve 2 closed ) 
the process starts again

Parameters:
The secondaryTank has an overflow port if the water volume level exceeds 50m ^ 3

the valve 2 has a flow rate at full opening = 167 Kg/sec
The secondary tank fills at a speed of 0.05 m ^ 3 / sec
the first emptying phase occurs at 280sec

=> cause the overflow of tank2 after about 1200sec from the start of the simulation
